# Smart-Motion-Activated-Lighting-with-Light-Level-Awareness using Arduino and Matlab

A **smart lighting system using Arduino and MATLAB** that activates lights only when motion is detected in low-light environments, with **real-time monitoring and visualization**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a **motion-activated lighting system** that:
✅ Uses a **PIR sensor** to detect motion.  
✅ Uses an **LDR sensor** to measure ambient light levels.  
✅ Activates **RGB LED** to indicate light conditions:
- **Red:** Very low light.
- **Yellow:** Medium-low light.
- **Green:** Sufficient light (light remains off even if motion detected).

✅ Sends real-time data to the Serial Monitor and plots live in MATLAB.
